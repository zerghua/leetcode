The question was "find maximum forward difference between two numbers in a series of numbers. The program should print out the max difference and the index location of the two elements used"


Given a string, convert it into a palindrome with the lease number of insertions possible.
For each string, if left char = right char, no need to insert, cut the two ends. If left != right, only no decision, insert the right char to left or insert the left char to right. Both increment the total insert by 1.

int FindMinInsert(string s, int l, int r)
{ if ( l >= r ) return 0;
     if (s[l] == s[r]) return FindMinInsert(s, l+1, r-1);
     int insert_left = FindMinInsert(s, l, r-1) +1;
     int insert_right = FindMinInsert(s, l+1, r) +1;
     return min(insert_left, insert_right);

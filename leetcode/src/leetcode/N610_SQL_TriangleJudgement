/*

A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.
However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle,
assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |

For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:

| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

For example, if file.txt has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30

Output the following:

name alice ryan
age 21 30



-- 8/10/2017
-- 17 / 17 test cases passed.
-- 25 ms

Just feel free to use for and if.
You can append string easily, for example, s = s a to append a with s.

awk '
{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        if(NR == 1) {
            s[i] = $i;
        } else {
            s[i] = s[i] " " $i;
        }
    }
}
END {
    for (i = 1; s[i] != ""; i++) {
        print s[i];
    }
}' file.txt
